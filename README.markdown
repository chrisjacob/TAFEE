# Boilerplate for Tiered, Adaptive Front-end Experiences (TAFEE)

> TAFEE (_pronounced: taffy_): tiered, adaptive front-end experiences. 
> Customizing the experience to the unique capabilities of each browser, prioritizing a fast and good UX over consistency.

Full credit to [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish) & [@SlexAxton](https://github.com/SlexAxton) for coining `TAFEE`. Paul Irish eloquently explains the concept of [Tiered, Adaptive Front-end Experiences](http://paulirish.com/2011/tiered-adaptive-front-end-experiences/).

I've brashly poached the acronym for this project as it hits the nail on the head for what I'm attempting to build.

Also the relationship with Taffy gives me the excuse I've been looking for to build a candy-pink UX!

> Taffy is made by stretching or pulling a sticky mass of boiled sugar, butter or vegetable oil, 
> flavorings, and coloring until fluffy.

... sounds remarkably familiar to the process of building Fluid, Mobile First, Adaptive Web Designs ...

I'll be experimenting on the [GitHub Pages Branch](https://github.com/chrisjacob/TAFEE/tree/gh-pages) so the "demo" is automatically hosted for feedback and browser testing.
